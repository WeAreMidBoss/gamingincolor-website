	<h1>ABRIDGED GALACTIPEDIA OF SELECTED WORLDS</h1>
	<span>COURTESY  INTERSOL  DEPARTMENT  OF INTEL</span>
	<h2>AMETHYST</h2>
	<p>Amethyst's skyline is dominated by the Crystal Mountains of its northern continent. The mountains are inhabited by silicon-based lifeforms who communicate by dispersing charges of electricity. In their wars with the carbon-based nations of the planetary south - who seek to annex their crystals for use in weapons - and jewelry-making - this has found a dual purpose as a formidable weapon. A tentative peace exists between the north and the south currently, though there are stories of illegal raids for crystal shards.

	<p>The large planet has three moons: Garnet, the larger, further moon; Sapphire, a small, nearer moon that makes three rotations around the planet a day; and Element, a moon composed of pure crystal that is believed to have broken off of one of the taller crystal mountains millenia ago. The daily calendars of most Amethyne nations are organized around the motions of Sapphire, while the seasonal calendar is organized around the slower movement of the larger moon, Garnet.
	<h2>BIG GUY</h2>
	<p> Big Guy is an enormous cat drifting through space. His fur is predominantly purple, with a white belly and paws, and is about waist-high on the average bipedal creature. Big Guy is currently inhabited by a tribe of deep-space nomads who have established a settlement on his belly. Residents of Big Guy use a set of metal rakes to scratch the cat several times daily - if Big Guy were forced to scratch, the results for their settlement wold be catastrophic.

	<p>The inhabitants of the cat subside mainly on hunting - Big Guy has fleas. Through a long-practiced art, Big Guyans are able to trace the currents of their host's itches - and thus locate the fleas that are their primary source of sustenance. Big Guyan shish-kebab is considered a delicacy in many parts of the galaxy.

	<h2>FANTASTIC PLANET</h2>
	<p>Rebranded as a marketing ploy to bring in tourists, Fantastic Planet is a barren world of hot lava lakes and sulfur fumes. Originally colonized by religious isolationists in search of autonomy (they christened the world "Crucible"), the complete lack of food or other vital resources on the planet forced them to hastily adopt a new economic strategy.

	<p>The Fantastic Planet of today is known for its Bubble Casinos, which float high above the lava and sulfur gas. Once fully air conditioned, this technology had to be sacrificed in order to power the bright neon signs that glow within the bubbles. The most well-known of these is probably the sign that looms over the "Hey Baby" casino - a giant neon baby who greets tourists with a wink and a pointing finger. It is usually the first thing visitors to the planet see while approaching from space.

	<h2>FLUSTER</h2>
	<p>Fluster is not actually a planet so much as it is a dense cloud of gas. The inhabitants of the world use an invention called a "coolstaff" to freeze portions of the cloud into solid ice to navigate and to build stable structures. Having evolved in a groundless world, Flusterlings can make their lives on any side of a frozen surface. In the center of the great cloud is a huge ice sculpture built by many Flusterling ice artists using many coolstaves. In an homage to their world, the sculpture is shaped like an enormous cloud.

	<p>Their bodies adapted to endless plummets through the cloud, Flusterlings are known to enjoy riding and springing off of the many fanciful ice slides that now drift through Fluster. The slides are artifacts of one of Fluster's most popular sports, known as "Ice Skiing," which involves creating an ice slide beneath oneself with one's coolstaff while freefalling through the cloud.

	<h2>GAMMA PLAYA</h2>
	<p>Homeworld of the notorious Queen of Space and the seat of her world-spanning empire. The Queen's extensive harems of slaves have covered her planet in extravagent spectacles, known spiral-wide as the Wonders of Gamma Playa. These include the Summer Ice Palace, the Hanging Slave Gardens, the Ten-Mile-Tall Boot, the Bubble Dungeons, and the hedge maze surrounding the Queen's castle, which is so large as to be visible from space.

	<p>Efforts to emancipate the slave population were largely stymied when it was revealed that they had all provided consent, though the planet is still beset by activists who protest that slaves are "aiding and abetting" in their own debasement. Imperial soldiers have been trained to shoot these activists on sight.

	<h2>GEMRULE</h2>
	<p>A sizable population of robot colonists live in the four domes of Planet Gemrule, which are necessary to provide a hospitable environment for machine life on the inhospitable planet. (The Spring rains are a continuous downpour that would rust any robot, and Spring constitutes ten out of the twelve months of Gemrule's year.) The domes' artificial autumns are said to be rather lovely.

	<p>Gemrule's primary export, unsurprisingly, is gems, which are naturally formed in perfect, four-pointed shapes, and are then dyed in seven different colors (there are rumors of an illicit "maroon gem" trade, but the planet's authorities deny this). Gem mining, as well as all life support functions of the planet, are overseen by the psychic being known as the Mother Brain, Gemrule's central intelligence.

	<h2>GRUMPIRE</h2>
	<p>The two rival superpowers of Grumpire annihilated themselves in a fatal exchange of weaponry that left their atmosphere perpetually aflame. An extravagent Memorial Museum was quickly assembled on the planet's moon, Grumpile, containing a detailed history of the planet's civilization and the conflict that led to its unmaking. In the center of the Museum's mezzanine, surrounded by a zero-gravity fountain, is a deactivated mass bomb that failed to go off during the final war. A favorite local prank is to force tourists to bang on the bomb with a hammer - as the firing components of the bomb have been removed, it is completely harmless.

	<p>A sealed-bubble ferry departs every hour to take visitors on a fly-by of the planet's surface, visiting the ruins of several of the major cities: Groo Ha and Grimp City in the west and Vodor on the eastern continent. The continuous burning of the atmosphere, as seen from the inside, is said to look "pretty cool."

	<h2>HELLWORLD</h2>
	<p>Actually a really nice place. Hellworld is covered in flowers of tremendous beauty and variety. Prized among importers is the "Hell Creeper," a creeping vine that grows straight up from the ground in seeming defiance of gravity. The so-called "Flower Bed" of Hellworld is a room-sized pink blossom whose petals are sought after by the wealthy as bedding.
	<p>The principal metropolis of the planet is Float City, built on an enormous lilypad which floats on the rivers and lakes of the planet, constantly changing its location. In the Summer half of the year it can be found in the cooler northern hemisphere (typically in or around the miles-wide Lake of Stillness), while in the cold Winter it resides in the warmer southern hemisphere, drifting through a vast network of rivers and channels.

	<h2>HOTDOG</h2>
	<p>A deeply entrenched fungal network is constantly shifting and rearranging the terrain of Hotdog. Because this fungal lifeform seems to adhere to a rigid grid pattern, the result is that Hotdog is a shifting labyrinth of walls, like a hedge maze. Walls in a given region will often rearrange themselves with a week.

	<p>This unique topography has led the Iggland Empire to use the planet as a penal colony, establishing the fortress "Eye of the Maze" at the planet's northernmost pole. The first generation of prisoners, however, found quick and lucrative work as cartographers, mapping the constantly-changing landscape for the Eye's governors. Old maps, outdated in a week, fetch a high price as souvenirs on the interstellar market. Most of the planet's prisoners, as a result, reside in ornate mansions within the labyrinth.

	<h2>IGGLAND</h2>
	<p>A world covered almost entirely in water, Iggland is the seat of the Iggland Empire - a community of bureaucrats who occupy the sole island on the planet. The island is very small, less than 1% of the planet's surface area, and is covered almost entirely by the Imperial Palace. From the palace's lavishly decorated Throne Pit, the current Imperator Ultimax - chosen by lottery every dawn - manages the Empire by maintaining the Imperial List of Colony Planets, of which the Empire has achieved many by sending one or two colonists at most to each new world.

	<p>The nation is small, and owes its Empire to the natural geysers that erupt across the island (now in small courtyards within the palace). Plugging these geysers led to explosions that propelled the Igglandish - unintentionally, at first, then later deliberately - to the stars. Iggland early, involuntary explorers are recalled by the Empire's flag, which features an explosion in the color brown, a color that symbolizes bravery to the Igglandish. The flag has been famously compared to "a fart."

	<h2>LASERTRON</h2>
	<p>Lasers are actually banned within the planet-state of Lasertron, except during the twice-annual Royal Laser Festival in Grid Square. The Royal Family of Lasertron was deposed millenia ago in a bloody Laser Revolution, but the so-called Free Laser Republic that replaced it has kept the name out of tradition. Additionally, there are still references to the Lasertronnian god Infrared in Lasertron's national anthem despite the supposed seperation of church and state in the Republic.

	<p>The Royal Lasersmiths (inherited name) are capable of constructing lasers in brilliant cerulean, veridian, vermillion, and a fourth color somewhere between blue and orange that they call "bouillon." The secret of making magenta has unfortunately been lost to the ages.

	<h2>MAZEWORLD</h2>
	<p>The surface of this planet is continuously buffetted by radiation storms and is in fact uninhabited. Below the surface, however, the entire planet is linked by a vast network of tunnels and enormous caverns. Some, such as Hollow Belly, are large enough to contain their own atmosphere - clouds gather in the top of the cave, obscuring the cave ceiling.

	<p>Mazeworld has a considerable tourist economy - tourists pay to dress in period clothing and "adventure" in caves that have been fitted with "booby-taps" (harmless) and engage in mock battle with natives dressed as monsters. Adventurers who complete their "quests" are rewarded with souvenier trinkets, although some attractions like Torches Darken advertise treasures of real value, such as the Crystal Gauntlets of Planet Amethyst. Although Amethyst has filed many formal complaints, the Gauntlets remain in in a golden chest in the depths of Torches Darken, from which no adventurer has yet claimed them.

	<h2>SHAZAMM IV</h2>
	<p>The fourth planet orbiting Shazamm has a crust made entirely of crystallized sugar. All structures built by the inhabitants, therefore, can be considered to be temporary. Buildings are sculpted out of sugar and saliva to protect against the onset of winter, and then slowly consumed by the inhabitants by the spring. A family may pool their labor to construct an elaborate sugar mansion or castle, and then share the meal that it provides.

	<p>The core of the planet is made of molten caramel, which will occasionally burst from the planet in great volcanos. These spectacles attract interstellar tourists. Because of the danger of sweet-toothed tourists eating the inhabitants' homes, natives of Shazamm IV have taken to covering their residences with sugar spikes or constructing them in shapes chosen to induce fear. On the so-called Plain of Devils, a community of gargoyle-shaped sugar houses has arisen, every new sculpture bearing a more hideous face than the last.

	<h2>SOUVENIR</h2>
	<p>A planet of robot spiders, Souvenir is artificial as far as the eye can see. If one was to stand atop any of the perfectly conical mountains of Souvenir, one would see gleaming silver plains dotted with hexagonal trees and wirehair plants stretching in all directions. Though no water flows on this robot planet, the spiders have seen fit to simulate flowing rivers with clever light displays. The planet's Light Waterfalls are truly a sight to behold.

	<p>Souvenir is believed to have once been an organic planet, the robot spider population having been constructed by the original inhabitants. In the time since the extinction of the robots' builders - whether by natural or unnatural causes - the robots have redesigned the world, incorporating many of the planet's original landforms into their reconstruction. Souvenir's awe-inspiring Giant Metal Box Forests are believed to have originally been the ruins of cities of the planet's earlier civilization.

	<h2>RAMROD</h2>
	<p>Ramrod is what is commonly called a "nightplanet" - long ago and for unknown reasons, the planet shifted on its axis, to the effect that half of the planet is forever facing its sun and the other half is forever dark.

	<p>The lit side of the planet, Brightside, is mostly sparsely-vegetated desert. Brightside is dominated by a theocratic empire whose leaders, the Shadowless, officiate from the top of the Temple Luminous at the very center of the hemisphere. Religious oppression has caused many Brightsiders to flee to the Nightside, where loose anarchic tribal gangs live in homes carved from the giant, luminous mushrooms that grow in the unlit hemisphere. The Shadowless consider Nightside profane and have no designs for expanding their empire.

	<h2>ZOLTA</h2>
	<p>Because of its erratic orbit, the climate of Zolta is in constant flux. In order to survive, the life-forms of Zolta have become shape-shifters, capable of changing their bodies at will. Though Zoltans can take on any appearance, certain forms tend to become fashionable for a time. Though these trends seldom last - or rather end up ultimately transformed into something very different - a few shapes are "classics" and enjoy continued popularity. An example of this is the mobius strip, valued because of the technical skill required to achieve it.

	<p>Zoltan shape-shifters have adopted a service-based economy. Often Zoltans will offer services posing as furniture or, if the price is right, even shelter or housing. An enzyme allows the Zoltan physique to temporarily suppress its constant fluctuations, typically in preparation for mating. This ability has also been appropriated for the public shaming of criminals, who may be forcibly frozen for days or weeks into embarrassing forms - for example, a butt.
