HELLO! This game comes in two parts: one part, "game.html," is a 
branching story designed to be played in your web browser. The
other, "encyclopedia.txt," is a text file containing encyclopedic
information on sixteen imaginary planets. You will need both of 
these things to get the most out of this game!

The easiest way to have both story and encyclopedia next to one 
another is to open the file OPEN_ME.HTML in your web browser -
it'll open game.html and encyclopedia.txt in frames beside each 
other. You can move the dividing line to adjust the size of both 
frames.

Other options: open game.html and encyclopedia.txt in seperate 
windows and tab between them, print out encyclopedia.txt and 
consult it while playing through the story, put the encyclopedia 
on a handheld device, have a lover on another computer consult 
the encyclopedia and relay information to you.


There are a lot of different places to visit in a single game of
Where in the Galaxy is Kremlin San Antonio!
Play again to have new adventures.
